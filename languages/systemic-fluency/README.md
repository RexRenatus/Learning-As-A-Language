## 🎯 Why Cybersecurity as Primary Language?

Cybersecurity is my **high-priority immersion language**. Just like moving to a country to learn its language faster, I'm committing to **full immersion** in the security domain.

**Immersion approach**:
- **60% of weekly learning time** dedicated to security
- **Daily exposure**: CTF challenges, security blogs, vulnerability research
- **Living the language**: Thinking like both attacker and defender
- **Real-world practice**: Building tools, analyzing breaches, threat modeling
