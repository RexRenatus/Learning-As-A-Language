# ⚙️ Systemic Fluency — The Language of Complex Systems

![Phase](https://img.shields.io/badge/phase-foundation-yellow) ![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/progress-0%25-lightgrey) ![Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-beginner-blue)

> "To speak the language of systems is to understand how complexity emerges, how systems fail, and how to design resilient architectures."

## 🎯 What is Systemic Fluency?

Systemic Fluency is the **language of complexity**. It combines two subdialects:
- **Systems & Processes** - Understanding how complex systems work and evolve
- **Cybersecurity** - Understanding how systems are attacked and defended

Together, they form a unified way to see, design, and secure complex adaptive systems.

---

## 🗣️ Subdialects

### 🔄 Systems & Processes
The vocabulary of interconnection
- Systems thinking fundamentals
- Process design and optimization
- Feedback loops and emergence
- Resilience engineering
- Organizational systems

### 🔒 Cybersecurity
The grammar of protection
- Threat modeling
- Attack vectors and defense strategies
- Security architecture
- Incident response
- Risk assessment

---
