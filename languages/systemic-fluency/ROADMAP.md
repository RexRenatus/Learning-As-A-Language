## ⚠️ Risk Factors & Mitigation

### **Risk 1: CCNA exam difficulty underestimated**
**Impact**: Delays CISM timeline

**Mitigation**:
- Start Boson practice exams by Week 8 (early November)
- If scoring <800 on practice, add 2 weeks to CCNA prep
- Delay CISM start by 2 weeks if needed (still achievable by March)

---

### **Risk 2: CISM exam without practical experience**
**Impact**: Exam more challenging without field experience

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on theoretical knowledge and frameworks
- Study case studies extensively
- Use practice questions to understand management perspective
- CISM is knowledge-based, not skills-based (passable with study)

---

### **Risk 3: Burnout from intense pace**
**Impact**: Study quality decreases, motivation drops

**Mitigation**:
- Build in 1 rest day per week (Sunday recommended)
- Celebrate small wins (completing each domain, passing practice exams)
- Use immersion journal to track energy and adjust pace
- Connect with study groups for motivation

---

### **Risk 4: CISM certification delayed 3-5 years**
**Impact**: Cannot claim "CISM Certified" immediately

**Acceptance**:
- This is expected and planned for
- Value is in passing the exam (proves knowledge)
- Opens doors to roles that build required experience
- Resume: "CISM Exam Passed (Certification pending experience requirement)"
