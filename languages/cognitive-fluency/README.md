# 🧠 Cognitive Fluency — The Language of Rational Thought

![Phase](https://img.shields.io/badge/phase-foundation-yellow) ![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/progress-0%25-lightgrey) ![Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-beginner-blue)

> "To speak the language of rationality is to understand how minds work, how to reason formally, and how to think strategically."

## 🎯 What is Cognitive Fluency?

Cognitive Fluency is the **language of how we think**. It combines three subdialects:
- **Psychology** - Understanding human behavior and mental processes
- **Logic** - Formal reasoning and argumentation structures
- **Game Theory** - Strategic decision-making and interaction

Together, they form a unified way to understand and improve rational thought.

---

## 🗣️ Subdialects

### 🧩 Psychology
The vocabulary of mind and behavior
- How humans process information
- Cognitive biases and heuristics
- Motivation, emotion, learning
- Mental models and perception

### 🔷 Logic
The grammar of rational thought
- Formal reasoning systems
- Logical fallacies
- Proof techniques
- Critical thinking frameworks

### 🎲 Game Theory
The syntax of strategic interaction
- Decision theory
- Nash equilibria
- Mechanism design
- Negotiation and cooperation

## 📚 Phase 1: Foundation (Pre-training)

**Goal**: Build broad understanding of how rational thought works

### Core Concepts to Learn
- [ ] Cognitive biases (anchoring, confirmation bias, availability heuristic)
- [ ] System 1 vs System 2 thinking (Kahneman)
- [ ] Propositional and predicate logic
- [ ] Common logical fallacies
- [ ] Game theory fundamentals (prisoner's dilemma, coordination games)
- [ ] Decision trees and expected utility

### Resources
- [ ] **Book**: "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman
- [ ] **Book**: "The Art of Logic" by Eugenia Cheng
- [ ] **Course**: Game Theory (Coursera - Stanford/Yale)
- [ ] **Video**: Crash Course Psychology series
- [ ] **Resource**: LessWrong sequences on rationality

### Foundation Progress
- **Concepts mastered**: 0/6
- **Resources completed**: 0/5
- **Notes created**: [foundation/](foundation/)

## 🎯 Phase 2: Practice (Fine-tuning)

**Goal**: Apply cognitive concepts through hands-on exercises

### Projects
- [ ] Create mental model library (Notion/Obsidian)
- [ ] Solve logic puzzles and proof exercises
- [ ] Analyze real-world strategic scenarios
- [ ] Write blog posts explaining cognitive biases
- [ ] Build decision-making framework for daily use

### Labs & Exercises
- [ ] Daily logic puzzle practice
- [ ] Behavioral experiment design
- [ ] Game theory simulations
- [ ] Debate and argument mapping
- [ ] Prediction tracking (calibration)

### Practice Progress
- **Projects completed**: 0/5
- **Labs completed**: 0/5
- **Artifacts created**: [practice/](practice/)

## 👍 Phase 3: Mastery (RLHF)

**Goal**: Refine through real challenges and teaching

### Challenges

- [ ] Design game-theoretic mechanisms for real problems
- [ ] Teach cognitive bias workshops
- [ ] Write comprehensive guide on strategic thinking
- [ ] Mentor others in rational decision-making

### Contributions
