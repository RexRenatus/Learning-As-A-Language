## 💡 Why This Language Family

### Core Intelligence Questions

Human Systems answers the **"Who?"** and **"Why?"** questions:
- **Who** are the actors (individuals, groups, organizations)?
- **Why** do they behave this way (incentives, biases, culture)?
- **How** do human systems scale from individuals to civilizations?

### Critical for Primary Goals

**For Cybersecurity**:
- Social engineering attacks exploit psychological biases (Stage 1)
- Understanding attacker incentives (Economics Stage 2)
- Insider threat analysis requires psychology + sociology

**For Intelligence Analysis**:
- Psychology: Cognitive biases in analysis (absolutely essential)
- Economics: Understanding state incentives and constraints
- Sociology: Cultural factors in conflict and radicalization
- Biology: Evolutionary psychology for predicting behavior

**For Strategic Thinking**:
- Game Theory requires understanding of incentives (Economics)
- Military/Political strategy requires cultural understanding (Sociology)
- Leadership requires psychology
