### Stage 3: Intermediate Core (Science of the Craft)
**Duration**: 6-8 weeks
**Textbook**: *Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations* by Michael Walzer

- Proportionality (benefits outweigh harms)
- Last resort (all peaceful means exhausted)
- Legitimate authority (proper authority declares war)
- Reasonable chance of success

**Jus in bello** (Justice in War - how to fight justly?):
