# 📊 Metrics — Progress Tracking

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-tracking-green) ![Updated](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_update-2025--10--12-blue)

This folder tracks **quantitative progress** across all four language families, showing your journey from beginner to fluency.

## 🎯 What Are Metrics?

Metrics answer the questions:
- **How fluent am I** in each language?
- **How fast am I progressing**?
- **Where should I focus** next?
- **Am I on track** to hit my goals?

Unlike goals (which are time-based) and journals (which are qualitative), metrics are **data-driven indicators** of mastery.

## 📁 Files in This Folder

### [language-progress.md](language-progress.md)
**Per-language fluency tracking**
- Current level (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Native)
- Progress in each phase (Foundation/Practice/Mastery)
- Hours invested
- Milestones achieved

### [learning-velocity.md](learning-velocity.md)
**Overall learning pace**
- Weekly time allocation per language
- Learning efficiency trends
- Velocity over time (are you accelerating or plateauing?)

## 📊 Fluency Scale

Each language is measured on a 5-level scale:

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Beginner** | 0-20% | Building vocabulary, consuming resources, taking notes |
| **Intermediate** | 20-50% | Applying concepts, completing projects, some fluency |
| **Advanced** | 50-80% | Solving real problems, teaching others, deep expertise |
| **Expert** | 80-95% | Mastery in multiple subdomains, recognized expertise |
| **Native** | 95-100% | Fluent across all contexts, contributing to the field |

## 📈 How Metrics Are Updated

### Daily (via Journal)
As you work and update your [journal](../journal/), note:
- Time spent on each language
- Tasks completed
- Resources consumed

### Weekly
During weekly reviews:
1. Sum hours per language from journal entries
2. Update phase percentages based on checklist completion
3. Calculate learning velocity
4. Update [learning-velocity.md](learning-velocity.md)

### Monthly
During monthly reviews:
1. Assess overall fluency level changes
2. Update [language-progress.md](language-progress.md)
3. Identify trends (accelerating/plateauing)
4. Adjust focus based on data

## 🎯 Tracking Methods

### Phase Completion %
**Formula**: (Completed items / Total items) × 100

Example for Cognitive Fluency Foundation:
- Total foundation items: 11 (6 concepts + 5 resources)
- Completed: 0
- Foundation %: 0%

### Hours Invested
Track via journal entries:
- Note start/end times for focused work
- Exclude breaks and distractions
- Count only deep work time

### Learning Velocity
**Formula**: Progress % / Time invested

Example:
- Cognitive Foundation: 10% complete in 20 hours = 0.5% per hour
- Expressive Foundation: 15% complete in 15 hours = 1.0% per hour
- → Expressive is 2x faster (adjust strategy?)

## 💡 Using Metrics Wisely

### Do
- ✅ Track consistently (weekly minimum)
- ✅ Use data to guide focus ("I'm weak in Practice phase")
- ✅ Celebrate milestones visibly
- ✅ Adjust strategy based on velocity

### Don't
- ❌ Obsess over numbers (quality > quantity)
- ❌ Compare to others (your journey is unique)
- ❌ Let metrics override intrinsic motivation
- ❌ Fake progress to look good (be honest)

**Remember**: Metrics are a tool to improve learning, not the goal itself.
