# 📔 Learning Journal

This journal documents the daily journey of acquiring fluency across four language families: Cognitive, Expressive, Systemic, and Financial.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The journal serves as:
- **Daily reflection** on learning progress
- **Progress tracker** linking to language families
- **Pattern recognition** for what works and what doesn't
- **Meta-learning lab** for improving the learning process itself

Unlike traditional journals, this one is structured around **language acquisition**, tracking which "languages" you practiced each day and what phase of learning (foundation/practice/mastery) you worked in.

## 📝 Entry Format

Each daily entry follows this structure:

1. **Languages Practiced** - Which language families you worked on
2. **What I Learned** - Organized by phase (foundation/practice/mastery)
3. **Progress Made** - Completed items, in-progress work, blockers
4. **Key Insights** - Aha moments and cross-language connections
5. **Tomorrow's Focus** - Primary language and specific tasks

See the template: [templates/daily-entry.md](templates/daily-entry.md)

## 🗓️ Naming Conventions

- **Year folder**: 4 digits (e.g., `2025`)
- **Month folder**: 2 digits, zero-padded `01-12` (e.g., `09`)
- **Entry file**: `YYYYMMDD.md` (e.g., `20250928.md`)

**Example path**: `journal/2025/09/20250928.md`

---

## ✍️ How to Create a New Entry

### Manual Method
1. Create month folder if it doesn't exist: `journal/YYYY/MM/`
2. Copy the template: `templates/daily-entry.md`
3. Rename to today's date: `YYYYMMDD.md`
4. Fill in the sections as you work throughout the day

### Quick Start
```bash
# Copy template to today's entry
cp journal/templates/daily-entry.md journal/2025/10/20251012.md
```

---

## 🔗 Linking Entries to Languages

Each entry should link back to relevant language progress:
- [🧠 Cognitive Fluency](../languages/cognitive-fluency/)
- [🗣️ Expressive Fluency](../languages/expressive-fluency/)
- [⚙️ Systemic Fluency](../languages/systemic-fluency/)
- [💰 Financial Fluency](../languages/financial-fluency/)

When you complete a task or milestone in a language, update both:
1. This journal entry (what you did)
2. The language's README (progress metrics)

---

## 📊 Journal as Data

Your journal entries become valuable data for:
- **Learning velocity** - How fast you're progressing per language
- **Pattern detection** - Which learning methods work best
- **Time allocation** - How you distribute effort across languages
- **Synthesis opportunities** - Where languages intersect

This data feeds into: [metrics/learning-velocity.md](../metrics/learning-velocity.md)

---

## 🌟 Best Practices

### Daily Habits
- ✅ Write entries **same day** (don't retroactively fill in)
- ✅ Be **honest about blockers** and challenges
- ✅ Note **cross-language insights** when you see them
- ✅ Link to **specific progress** in language folders

### What to Capture
- **Foundation work**: Books read, concepts studied, notes created
- **Practice work**: Projects built, exercises completed, skills practiced
- **Mastery work**: Real challenges solved, teaching done, contributions made
- **Meta-learning**: What worked, what didn't, how to improve the process

### What Not to Do
- ❌ Don't retroactively rename dated files
- ❌ Don't skip days and batch-fill later (loses authenticity)
- ❌ Don't just list tasks (reflect on *why* and *how*)
