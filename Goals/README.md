# 🎯 Goals — Time-Based Execution

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen) ![Period](https://img.shields.io/badge/current-2025--Q4-blue)

This folder tracks **time-based execution** of language learning goals using a quarterly → monthly → weekly hierarchy.

## 🎭 Goals vs Languages

**Important distinction**:
- **[Languages](../languages/)** = *What* you're learning (Cognitive, Expressive, Systemic, Financial)
- **Goals** = *When* you're executing on that learning (time-based milestones)

Goals are the **execution layer** that sits on top of your language learning journey. They answer: "What will I accomplish this quarter/month/week?"

## 📊 Goal Hierarchy

```
Quarterly (3 months)
    ↓
Monthly (4 weeks)
    ↓
Weekly (7 days)
    ↓
Daily (journal entries)
```

### Quarterly Goals
**Scope**: 3-month objectives aligned with language learning phases
- Major milestones (e.g., "Complete foundation phase for Cognitive Fluency")
- Big projects (e.g., "Build and document security home lab")
- Skill transitions (e.g., "Move from beginner to intermediate in Technical Writing")

### Monthly Goals
**Scope**: 4-week sprints with specific deliverables
- Books to complete
- Projects to finish
- Practice routines to establish
- Measurable progress in languages

### Weekly Goals
**Scope**: 7-day focus areas
- Specific tasks and exercises
- Daily practice targets
- Short-term experiments
- Review and adjustment

## 🔗 Linking Goals to Languages

Every goal should link back to language progress:

**Example**:
- **Goal**: "Complete 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' book"
- **Language**: [Cognitive Fluency - Foundation](../languages/cognitive-fluency/)
- **Phase**: Pre-training
- **Metric**: Updates foundation checklist

---

## 🗓️ Current Period

### Q4 2025 (October - December)
**Focus**: Establish foundation phase across all 4 languages

**Quarterly objectives**:
- [ ] Build language learning infrastructure (this repo)
- [ ] Start foundation work in all 4 languages
- [ ] Establish daily journal habit
- [ ] Create metrics tracking system

### October 2025
**Sprint goal**: Repository transformation and language setup

See current month: [monthly/2025-10/](monthly/)

### Week 41 (Oct 7-13, 2025)
**Focus**: Repository reorganization using language learning model

See current week: [weekly/](weekly/)

## ✍️ How to Use This System

### At the Start of Each Quarter
1. Review last quarter's progress
2. Set 3-4 major objectives for next 3 months
3. Create `quarterly/YYYY-QX/objectives.md`
4. Align objectives with language learning phases

### At the Start of Each Month
1. Break down quarterly objectives into monthly sprint
2. Create `monthly/YYYY-MM/sprint.md`
3. Define specific deliverables and metrics
4. Link to language checklists

### At the Start of Each Week
1. Review monthly sprint progress
2. Create `weekly/YYYY-WXX/focus.md`
3. Define 3-5 key tasks for the week
4. Block time for each language family

### Daily
1. Check weekly focus in morning
2. Work on language-specific tasks
3. Update [journal](../journal/) in evening
4. Note progress toward weekly/monthly/quarterly goals

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Goals serve languages, not the other way around** - Don't let time pressure override learning quality
2. **Weekly reviews are essential** - Adjust course based on what's working
3. **Link everything** - Goals → Languages → Journal → Metrics
4. **Be realistic** - Better to accomplish 3 focused goals than rush through 10
5. **Celebrate progress** - Mark completions visibly (checkboxes, badges, metrics)
