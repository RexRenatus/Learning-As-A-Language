# Language Family Architecture Design

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Purpose**: Organize 28 disciplines into 8 coherent language families
**Approach**: Minimize redundancy, maximize pattern transfer, support Cybersecurity primary goal

---

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Logical Grouping**: Disciplines with shared mental models in same family
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Foundational → Intermediate → Advanced → Applied
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Explicit cross-references to meta-patterns
4. **Parallel Learning**: Families can be studied simultaneously with clear prerequisite chains
